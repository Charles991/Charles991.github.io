					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I am currently a computer forensics and cybersecurity student at Canterbury Christ Church University with a life long interest in computers and technology. Aside from computers and cybersecurity I enjoy staying fit and regularly exercise. I like going for long walks and swimming. I love film making and cinema. I frequently watch films and love learning about certain film directors and the history of cinema. I also directed a film which was a runner up in a Short Film Contest. I really like to read about topics that interest me including history, geopolitics, science and technology. I am currently teaching myself Spanish. I really enjoy playing Chess and play whenever I can.</p>
